# car_project

## TODOs
* ~~Downsample clouds to improve performance~~
* ~~Testing for how good the transformations actually are~~
* ~~Implement cluster extraction (Euclidean Cluster Extraction?)~~
* ~~Choose correct cluster to apply transformation~~
* ~~Transform OpenCV bounding boxes to ROS messages to choose correct cluster~~
* Pose estimation
    * Feature Extraction
    * Feature Matching
    * ICP (This is implimented, but it's not good enough. Extracting features should make it a lot easier to compare the target in the scene with the model)
